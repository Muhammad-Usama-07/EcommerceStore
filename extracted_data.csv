2025-04-04 20:02:30,vape,mango,"Do NOT go to Dubai desert safari This was a full on tourist scam from start to end.
Our tourist guide for Dubai desert safari told us it would be 260 for 2 people, for vip buffet with camel ride henna drawing and sand duning 

But once we got in the car for the pick up, I asked to pay him, he says pay me later, not now (fake kindness ). 

After we were on the way, he stops at a shop and says go toilet here, other toilets are dirty.
The shop was tourist trap number 1, you go in and they tell you a headscarf is 40 dirham then they help you put on and when you go to check out, it‚Äôs 80 dirham, basically a psychological effect since you can‚Äôt take it off and you end up buying a scarf that costs 10 dirham normally.

Later on when we arrived at the desert area for sand duning, it was a waste of time in all honesty.
Afterwards , we got taken to a camp, another tourist trap. Our guide suddenly says it‚Äôs private vehicle he organised(even tho his ad mentioned it was a private pick and drop) so we have to pay him 1000 dirham(500 per person), from 260 dirham , it became 1000 dirham, we argued a while back and forth and he agreed to 600 dirham‚Ä¶ 
Total scam.

Later at the camp, 
A turd forces us to take pics and say it‚Äôs for himself then comes and sell us each pic for 50 dirham, and we refuse, he says some bullshit in Arabic and leaves. He later does it to all other customers. 

Later some guys offer juice saying normal for 40 but for us it‚Äôs 30(they say it to all) , once it arrives , it‚Äôs a small box filled with water mostly, afterwards they say pay the bill, which is 10% tax, I argued Dubai has 5% only and you have to show on menu or it‚Äôs against law, they say no sir and stall it and we didn‚Äôt want to make a scene so we paid 66 dirham for 2 glass of watered mango juice.
For the free henna painting and camel ride, we decided not to do it so free henna painting was one finger they said but we noticed on other tourists, once start on finger, they went all over the hand then forced the payment from others, camel ride was similar with 1 minute only free but they extended the time on the tourists to extort fees, so we decided to skip it.


In the end we told our driver to take us back home early since it felt like a huge disappointment. 
Total waste of our day‚Ä¶

I picked it up to eat at home so I think the crust might have lost its fresh out the oven texture and it was a bit soggy. I'm gonna eat the rest tomorrow so I'll put it in the oven to get a bit more of a crisp on it. 
Also got their tagliatelle bolognese - it's oookk. It's not gross but I wouldn't order it again. Tastes like they didn't cook the tomatoes down long enough, and it doesn't have that comforting taste. My 4 hour slow cooked bolognese with fresh herbs is better üòÖ


I'm on a mission to find GOOD pizza. Like. GOOD. F*ING. PIZZA! 

I used to live very close to Italy and also in the states for a while so I could find good pizza just about anywhere but seems hard here, even at the ""top recommended"" places. 

I've  been keeping notes because it's bothering me that good pizza seems difficult to find here. This is what I've tried so far (at least what I managed to keep notes on, the rest were also forgettable). Some are just random places I stumbled across, or from deliveroo, others are what people recommended.  I'll update this list as I try more. 


Pedjas kraft koffee - LAME. So so lame. Tastes like a cheap frozen pizza from Tesco or some shit. Definitely would not eat again. The crust was dense - not light, airy, fluffy crunch. Just solid tough and dense. I normally love the crust but I ended up feeding them to the birds this time. 

Circle of crust - nightmare. Not even if you paid me to eat it again. 

Pinza- meh. I dont remember anything about it other than i thought it was a let down. Forgettable. 

Pitfire - disappointing. Would eat it if someone else ordered it at a party/gathering but I wouldn't pay to eat there pizza again. 

Mambo gourmet pizza JLT -  surprisingly nice. Pizza sauce had good flavour, actually enjoyed this one.  Exceeded expectations, but my expectations were low to begin with. Restaurant smelt a bit weird. Would try again just to confirm that it was actually as good as I remember it being. 


If you have any recommendations please share! I want proper Italian pizza with a puffed up light airy crust with a little crunch to it, and flavooouuurrr.

* Karachi-style Biryani: Tried Nayab Handi recently (delivered by Smiles) and it was alright. Pak Liyari hits the spot but their Bur Dubai brand always runs out of Chicken Biryani which I prefer.
* Hyderabadi Biryani: I still crave for an authentic and fresh Chicken 65 biryani. Tried different places, and most of them give stale chicken that is rubbery and tastes bad.
* Bombay/Mumbai Biryani: Chaiwaala Cafe in Al Quoz comes close to the authentic flavours of Mumbai biryani.
* Lucknowi Biryani: Heard a lot about this, but don't know where to find it in Dubai with authentic taste.

2025-04-28 13:59:10,vape,dessert,"Creator of viral 'Dubai Chocolate' recipe says he was written out of global success story - Arabian Business: Latest News on the Middle East, Real Estate, Finance, and More From the article: 

The Filipino chef who co-created Dubai‚Äôs viral pistachio kunafa chocolate has revealed he was an original investor in the venture before stepping away‚Äîonly to watch the product achieve global recognition without him.

Chef Nouel Catis, a dessert specialist with 16 years of experience in the UAE, said in an exclusive interview with Arabian Business that he co-developed the confection for FIX Dessert Chocolatier and helped purchase equipment to launch the brand. However, he exited the business arrangement before it went viral.

‚ÄúIt was really the intention to have an equal partnership, where I put my money into the technical side, the operational side, while she [Sarah Hamouda] does the branding [and] marketing,‚Äù said Catis, referring to FIX‚Äôs founder.

Catis said he felt disappointed at being excluded from the brand‚Äôs public narrative as its success grew.

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm paid for my work as a consultant, I don‚Äôt expect credit. But if it‚Äôs a collaborative project‚Äîsomething we developed together‚Äîthen [credit] should be given,‚Äù he said.

Much of FIX‚Äôs origin story, widely reported as stemming from Hamouda‚Äôs pregnancy cravings, remains intact. Catis confirmed she was pregnant during their partnership but noted, ‚ÄúChefs are there because if you don‚Äôt have the skill set, they‚Äôre there to make things happen.‚Äù

He added that the growing media attention around the brand risks diminishing the role of professional chefs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of saying to chefs that their profession isn‚Äôt something you work hard on. We need to validate that chefs have worked to become who they are,‚Äù he said.

Intellectual property lessons from viral success

The pistachio kunafa chocolate bars‚Äîblending nut cream and pastry inside a thick chocolate shell‚Äîexploded in popularity in 2024, triggering pistachio shortages and global imitation.

As FIX‚Äôs profile rose internationally, Catis said he found himself largely omitted from the public narrative, despite creating the signature recipe and investing in the initial production setup.

‚ÄúThe main takeaway for me was, because of what happened, I became a wiser person,‚Äù he said, urging culinary entrepreneurs to prioritise legal clarity. ‚ÄúIf you have to start a business with a friend or family member, you have to do what is right from the start, which is doing paperwork.‚Äù

According to Catis, the two initially registered the business as partners with local authorities, but that registration was allowed to lapse. In 2022, Hamouda went on to trademark the brand independently, around the time Catis shifted into more of a support role rather than continuing as a partner. He said the arrangement gradually dissolved without a formal discussion.

From Jordan to Dubai

Catis‚Äôs passion for Middle Eastern flavours began in Jordan, where he was first introduced to authentic Nabulsi kunafa.

‚ÄúI fell in love with Arabic desserts and food. It just made sense for me when I was in Jordan, that I should continue my journey in the Middle East,‚Äù he said.

Before the rise of ‚ÄúDubai chocolate,‚Äù Catis had already made a name for himself as a dessert innovator across the Gulf, contributing to several brands including Kuwait‚Äôs Choco Melt.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the only thing I‚Äôve made viral‚Äîbut it‚Äôs the only one that made it global,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost of my clients are Kuwaitis. I‚Äôve done a lot of famous recipes in the Middle East.‚Äù

He recalled the painstaking early days of FIX, making chocolate bars by hand and delivering them to friends, influencers, and family for feedback. The process caused physical strain and eventually led to investment in tempering machines and custom molds to meet demand.

‚ÄúI was making 28 bars at a time. It was very difficult,‚Äù he said, describing the 200-gram signature bars as ‚Äúthick and iconic.‚Äù

Despite the challenges and the outcome, Catis said he bears no ill will toward the product‚Äôs imitators.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked on so many brands that became iconic, and they all got copied. I‚Äôm okay with it, because it shows the idea works.‚Äù

The Dubai chocolate phenomenon has had a noticeable impact on global markets, with pistachio prices reportedly rising from $7.65 to $10.30 per pound. Iran increased pistachio exports to the UAE by 40 per cent to meet surging demand.

Catis‚Äôs new venture, Snaap DXB, sold out its initial 3,000-bar batch within two days of launch in October 2024. The brand opened its first physical store in Dubai‚Äôs Marsa Boulevard in February 2025.

He now hopes to position Snaap as a homegrown UAE brand with global aspirations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a brand that can probably say it‚Äôs made in the UAE, and it will represent the UAE to the world,‚Äù he said.

Arabian Business reached out to FIX Dessert Chocolatier for comment but had not received a response by publication time.

Some people say stick it all in check-in luggage some others suggest keep it all on hand luggage. Im simple totally unsure now. Any helps would the much much appreciated. 

We wont be leaving the airport at all during our layovers.

Would appreciate your advice on below situation which has been bothering for few weeks now without any improvement.

  
Living with a family in an apartment. There are a couple of tenants on same floor who always keep their doors half opened. This causes weird smells (depending on their food/cooking), smoke smell from vaping or ciggarettes and whole corrdor smells bad and sometimes they are either on their calls or watching television which brings loud noise to corrdor. It feels super bad especially when you are paying high prices and wanting a good feel all around. 

  
We complained to security and they said they have talked to these people but the next day the doors are again opened giving a very bad impression and feeling in corrdor. Not to forget it also affects the temperature of the corridor by bringing extra humidity.

  
What are these tenants wanting to achieve? Can someone enlighten please? 

  
Also, what can be done? Go and talk to them directly? Will it escalate the situation?

  
Would love some good suggestions from people who may have faced similar situations.

I'll have a meal then vape with my beer, but generally don't if someone next to me is eating. Besides me were a middle aged American couple and a guy smoking a cigar on the other side. After everyone finished their meals, everyone was smoking. One side cigar, myself a vape, and the American husband rolled tobacco. When the husband went to the washroom, the American wife started yelling at me coz the smoke is going to her face. It's obviously unusual for a random person to confront a stranger about something permitted in public. I responded by ignoring her but she went full Karen 'excuse me! how dare you' type of language. I obviously saw where this was going, having seen Karen videos online, but decided to remain silent. I didn't expect the staff to back me either against an older American couple so I remained quiet, which made her more infuriated. Fortunately after badmouthing me to her husband, he decided they should pay and leave.

1. Best overall
Peru. Mesmerizing from the moment you step in the access bridge (especially it at night), and into the amazing three worlds of Peru.
Runner up: Benin. Tasteful and well thought journey, focused messaging showing ancient artifacts with their associated legends and stories.

2. The Design Award
UAE. Because of course, look at it, it must win. Plus the pavilion has wings, wings that flap, twice every day.
Runner up: Uzbekistan. Fantastic design and attention to detail, inside and out.
¬†
3. Best Concept Award
Syria. Thousands of Syrians poured their hearts into the pavilion, and it shows.
Runner up: Estonia. The closest manifestation to the metaverse (or a different take on the matrix). ¬†
¬†
4. Disappointment Award
UK: Lorem Ipsum is still Lorem Ipsum even if they say it isn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs just not pretend otherwise. ¬†
Runner up: Bahrain. A small country sometimes needs a big empty box.
¬†
5. Most creative Award:
Singapore. It is a building? Is it a tree? Is something in-between? Maybe a tropical building-tree. ¬†
Runner up: Pakistan: Two buildings presenting past and future in a connected journey. Hits you in the feels.
¬†
6. Tries-so-hard Award
Germany: You cannot not learn that stuff. Nien, you better learn this stuff, otherwise you don‚Äôt graduate.
Runner up: USA. Standing on a conveyor belt and forced to listen to propaganda felt un-American. ¬†

7. The simpleton Award
Austria: Feel, see, hear, smell, and touch the mud, with a couple of gimmicks. Simple but it works.
Runner up: Turkmenistan. We have horses, and empty spaces. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the Pavilion. ¬†¬†¬†¬†

8. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing Expo wrong, Bud‚Äù Award
Croatia: They forgot the exhibit and used the space as a parking lot.
